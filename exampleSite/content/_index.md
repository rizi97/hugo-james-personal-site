## About

I am currently Professor in the Department of Information & Decision Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago. I have a BA in Statistics and an MBA in Accounting from Indiana University and received my PhD in Computers and Information Systems from the University of Michigan. I have professional experience in the US as a certified public accountant and as a consultant in technology law in the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia. I am the author of numerous academic papers and of nine books: Audit Analytics (Springer 2020), Structural Equation Modeling (2nd ed. Springer 2019); Global Electronic Commerce (MIT Press 2000); Global Innovation Management (Palgrave Macmillan 2nd ed 2017); Red Wired: China’s Internet Revolution (Marshall Cavendish, 2010); Structural Equation Modeling (Springer 2015); Financial Dynamics (Wiley 2003); Valuing Technology (Wiley 2002) and Statistical Auditing with R (forthcoming 2018). I am the Editor-in-Chief of Electronic Commerce Research (Springer) and have served on editorial boards of several other information technology journals including Management Science, ISR, ECRA, IJEC, and others. I have served on the faculties at the University of Michigan, University of Southern California, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, University of Science and Technology of China, Harbin Institute of Technology and other academic institutions. In 2012 I received High-Level Foreign Expert status in China under the 1000-Talents Plan and am currently Overseas Chair Professor at Beihang University.
